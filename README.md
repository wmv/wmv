### Greetings 👋

I am a software engineer and product developer with roots in Ukraine (🇺🇦) and Angola (🇦🇴) and now residing in the vibrant city of Cape Town, South Africa (🇿🇦).

### Work 👨‍💻
My expertise lies in the digital product and ecosystem spaces. At the moment I am part of transforming ideas into innovative products at [MetaSolves](https://metasolves.co/).

Before this, I worked as one of the technical leads at [Moya](https://www.datafree.co/moya-messenger-app), the revolutionary #datafree messenger.

Before that, I was responsible for technology at [WumDrop](https://wumdrop.com/), a cutting-edge last mile logistics startup that operates across South Africa.

Do you need help with a project or have an idea that you'd like to turn into reality? [Drop me a line](mailto:hi@wmv.cx)!
I occasionally write about things I find interesting on my [blog](https://wmv.cx/blog).
